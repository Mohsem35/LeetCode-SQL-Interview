#### 1378. Replace Employee ID With The Unique Identifier


Table: Employees


| Column Name   | Type    |
|---------------|---------|
| id            | int     |
| name          | varchar |

id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table contains the id and the name of an employee in a company.


Table: EmployeeUNI

| Column Name   | Type    |
|---------------|---------|
| id            | int     |
| unique_id     | int     |

(id, unique_id) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table contains the id and the corresponding unique id of an employee in the company.

 

Write a solution to show the unique ID of each user, If a user does not have a unique ID replace just show null.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Employees table:

| id | name     |
|----|----------|
| 1  | Alice    |
| 7  | Bob      |
| 11 | Meir     |
| 90 | Winston  |
| 3  | Jonathan |

EmployeeUNI table:

| id | unique_id |
|----|-----------|
| 3  | 1         |
| 11 | 2         |
| 90 | 3         |

Output: 

| unique_id | name     |
|-----------|----------|
| null      | Alice    |
| null      | Bob      |
| 2         | Meir     |
| 3         | Winston  |
| 1         | Jonathan |


Explanation: 

Alice and Bob do not have a unique ID, We will show null instead.

The unique ID of Meir is 2.

The unique ID of Winston is 3.

The unique ID of Jonathan is 1.



```sql
SELECT employeeuni.unique_id, employees.name 
FROM employees
-- Unique ID variable doesn't exist will be shown as null, 
-- so EmployeeUNI table is put at the right side of LEFT JOIN function
LEFT JOIN employeeuni ON employees.id = employeeuni.id;
```

```sql
-- another approach
SELECT 
    COALESCE(eu.unique_id, NULL) AS unique_id,
    e.name
FROM
    Employees e
LEFT JOIN
    EmployeeUNI eu ON e.id = eu.id;
```
Uses the COALESCE function to return the first non-NULL value from the eu.unique_id column. **If `eu.unique_id` is NULL, it returns NULL**. This ensures that if there's no corresponding unique identifier in the EmployeeUNI table for an employee, it still returns a value (in this case, NULL) for the unique_id column.
