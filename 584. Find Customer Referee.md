#### 584. Find Customer Referee

Table: Customer


| Column Name | Type    |
|-------------|---------|
| id          | int     |
| name        | varchar |
| referee_id  | int     |

In SQL, id is the primary key column for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the id of a customer, their name, and the id of the customer who referred them.

 

Find the names of the customer that are not referred by the customer with `id = 2`

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.


Example 1:

Input:

Customer table:

| id | name | referee_id |
|----|------|------------|
| 1  | Will | null       |
| 2  | Jane | null       |
| 3  | Alex | 2          |
| 4  | Bill | null       |
| 5  | Zack | 1          |
| 6  | Mark | 2          |

Output: 

| name |
|------|
| Will |
| Jane |
| Bill |
| Zack |



```sql
SELECT name FROM customer
WHERE referee_id <> 2 
        OR referee_id IS NULL;
```

> যেহেতু referee_id `null` হলে ও output তে name show করতে হবে, তাই সাথে এই condition ও add হবে  


**Algorithm:**

MySQL uses three-valued logic 
1. TRUE 
2. FALSE 
3. UNKNOWN 

Anything compared to NULL evaluates to the third value: UNKNOWN. That “anything” includes NULL itself! That’s why MySQL provides the IS NULL and IS NOT NULL operators to specifically check for NULL.

Thus, one more condition **`referee_id IS NULL`** should be added to the WHERE clause as below.
